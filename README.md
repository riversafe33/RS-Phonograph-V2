rs_phonograph V2

Dependency

https://github.com/riversafe33/xsound

A NUI has been designed and the menu has been removed.

Rendering distance has been added so that if there are many phonographs placed, they won't load unnecessarily.

Key locking has been added so that if another script uses the same keys, it won't interfere while placing the phonograph.

If you have version 1, don't worry, as the SQL remains the same, but you will need to completely replace the script.

The option to loop the song has been added.

The dependency on uiprompt has been removed, and an NUI has been created to display the keys you need to use
